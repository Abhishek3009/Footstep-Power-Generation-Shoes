# Footstep-Power-Generation-Shoes

For an alternate method to generate electricity there are number of methods by which electricity can be produced, out if such methods footstep energy generation can be an effective method to generate electricity.  Walking is the most common activity in human life. When a person walks, he loses energy to the road surface in the form of impact, vibration, sound etc, due to the transfer of his weight on to the road surface, through foot falls on the ground during every step. This energy can be tapped and converted in the usable form such as in electrical form. 

Our objective is to design a model which uses the principle of piezoelectric transducers to generate electricity. This model, if embedded in a shoe of a person, can convert foot impact energy into electrical form which can be stored in a battery which is implanted in the shoe itself. The battery being charged is monitored by microcontroller and level is displayed using an output display.
